# Purpose

This repo has reached its end of life. 

This repo was used to create a github action that could get it's own IP address (for context this was to add the IP address to a security group to run unit tests. This was action superceded by dedicated runners. The runners are no longer needed any more eiter because we dont run those unit tests)

# actions-get-ip
GitHub action to get the IP address of the action
